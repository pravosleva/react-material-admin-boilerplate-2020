## Initial to-dos get displayed

Here is where weâ€™ll make use of the mount method, which allows us to go deeper than what shallow gives us. That way, we can check the length of the to-do items.

```js
it("displays initial to-dos", () => {
  const wrapper = mount(<Todo />);
  expect(wrapper.find("li")).toHaveLength(2);
});
```
